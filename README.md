# Home-Network

Using this repo to track my Home network project. 

I purchased a Qotom Q750G5 on Amazon. Load OPNSense got it up and running. It ran for a couple weeks. I unplugged it and plugged it back in, unit never booted again. :angry: It will be returned. :disappointed:

Next steps is to figure out what I am going to do or use as a FW/Router.
